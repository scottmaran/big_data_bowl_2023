Man Duel
    3 by 1 : three eligible receivers on one side, 1 on the other side
    Common offensive line protection is to slide to strong side
    - get running back out to a pass route
    - set protection based on the "mic", the key linebacker
    - Want inside foot up (besides center) - rather give pressure on outside instead of inside (13:30)

"Muggers" - linebackers stepped up to the LOS to create pressure, even if they don't blitz

(28:00) - every off. lineman takes a defensive lineman, leaves runnning back to pick up the rest

2 by 2:
    Can slide either way


Differences in how teams rush defenders (number, placement)

playclock importance?

(43:00) twist and biltz on opposite side


Empty - no running back in the backfield (5 eligble wide receivers)
    - makes defensives show their hand
    - High altert: in empty, usually going to be a twist
